### Option 2: Use External Cron Service (Free Alternative)

Use a free cron service like [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) or [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com):

1. Create account on cron service
2. Add these endpoints as scheduled jobs:
   - `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/onboarding-reminders`
   - `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/reengagement`
   - `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/admin-digest`

3. Set schedules:
   - Onboarding: Daily @ 10am
   - Re-engagement: Sundays @ 10am
   - Admin: Daily @ 8am

**Important**: Add authentication to protect cron endpoints!

### Option 3: Manual Triggering

You can manually trigger any cron job by visiting:
- `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/onboarding-reminders`
- `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/reengagement`
- `https://look4mentors.com/api/cron/admin-digest`

## Troubleshooting

### Cron Not Running?

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
   - Logs ‚Üí Filter by cron path
   - Look for errors

2. **Test Manually**
   - Visit the endpoint directly
   - Check if email sends

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - `EMAIL_FROM` set?
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` set?
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` set (for admin digest)?

4. **Check Database Connection**
   - Supabase credentials correct?
   - Database tables exist?

## Performance Considerations

### Current Load (2 active crons):
- **Session Reminders**: ~50-200 emails/day (depends on sessions)
- **Weekly Summary**: ~1000-5000 emails/week (depends on active users)

### Full Load (5 active crons):
- **Total**: ~10,000-20,000 emails/month
- **Resend Free Tier**: 3,000 emails/month ‚ùå
- **Resend Pro Required**: 50,000 emails/month ‚úÖ

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Vercel Free: $0 (2 crons limit)
- Vercel Pro: $20/month (unlimited crons)
- Resend Free: $0 (3,000 emails/month)
- Resend Pro: $20/month (50,000 emails/month)

**Recommended**: Both Vercel + Resend Pro = $40/month total

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor current crons** - Check if emails are sending
2. **Wait for user growth** - Upgrade when needed
3. **Consider external cron** - Free alternative
4. **Plan for scale** - Upgrade both services together

All cron job routes are **production-ready** and can be activated anytime! üöÄ
